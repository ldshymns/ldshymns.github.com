65 file has hymn 66 in it (repeat)


1. cropping files
For each file, view with gv.  Use cursor to find cropbox coordinate.
Change cropbox for each page, using the same right/left margins on all
pages.  Reload to verify.

(extract-cropbox.pl has functions to pull the crop info, and put it back)

2. joining pages
The autonup program will join the pages of those files which have 2 pages.
It uses pdflatex to do so, accounting for the strangenesses in latex 
nup function.

Single pages are also run through pdflatex to cleanup the damage caused
by changing the CropBoxes (mostly the pdf "index" doesn't point to the
right bytes).

3. Run makexml (check version) to create the upload config file.
